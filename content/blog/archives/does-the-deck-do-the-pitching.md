Hey friends!  
Hope you all had a grandiosa week.  

On my side I've been hard at work on a pitch deck.  
Yep, you read that correctly and I hope I'll be able to share a bit more soon!  


## ~~October~~November's game
October is coming to an end, and I'm not ready _at all_ to release pong-moba, the multiplayer game I'm working on.  
The good thing is, I did released a game in October, so this one can be the November game!  

I also found out that [someone released the game I was making, but better](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/ygllty/my_first_local_multiplayer_game_dashpong_is_now/)  

Congratulations to them, the game looks awesome!  
Don't worry I'm still doing mine ;)   

The todo list didn't move much since last week:
- [X] Top down character controller
- [X] Dash
- [X] Bouncy ball in enclosed space
- [ ] Create / join lobby (mostly done)
- [ ] Localhost multiplayer for debugging (some progress here)
- [ ] Multiplayer gameplay
- [ ] Score goals
- [ ] Movable walls
- [ ] Special abilities (Throw walls, dash, player quickly grows, ...)
- [ ] Matchmaking?

## Open sourcing the games
I just open source all monthly games, you can check them here:
