Lady and gentlemen!  
Friends and Family!  
This guy!  
Welcome to the annual, yearly, 1st ceremony of the 2022 Goal Awards!  
Let's get right into it.

## 2022 Goals
I started 2022 with some goals, let see how they did this year!
### - Lose weight
After winning the `Most original new year resolution` award, this goal was dedicated to achieve itself. Well... *pauses for dramatic effect*... it did not!  
**\*\*Gasps\*\***  
Still let's give it a participation medal for staying here all year and not swapping place with its more performing brother: **Gaining weight**  
### - Release games
Started as the most ambitious goal of 2022, transformed itself into: `Release a game a month from September to December`.  
It did manage to release 2 games - but will this be enough?  
### - Take care of my family and our house
This goal did very well for himself!  
I'm lucky to have such a supporting family, a never ending sweetener for those never ending house lemonades! [Thank you Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeJ1Sauv2gc).
### - Grow professionally
Most well defined goal of the year, the only one that managed to be fully completed: it's easy to grow when you don't specify direction and length.

## 2023 Goals
### - Lose weight
**\*\*Gasps\*\***  
### - Release games
Wait...
### - Take care of my family and our house
Ok I see where this is going...
### - Publish more game dev content

&nbsp;  

Yes, my goals for this year did not change a lot.  
They are more a statement of where I want to go rather than actually what I need to achieve this year.  
Let's hope next year will be as good as this one!

Enjoy your end of year celebrations!
