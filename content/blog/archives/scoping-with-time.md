Hi there!  
I hope you are all doing great.

I'm back from some well deserved vacations, where I had time to do some thinking:  
My life goal is be able to sustain my family with money from *making games* and vegetables from our garden, so I better start working toward this.

The first milestone is *to get good at making games*.  
I don't want to make the perfect game, I don't expect to make money, I only want to become good at shipping games - so I need to ship *a lot* of games.  
While I'm at it, I'll also work on my visibility, and try to have my games played by more and more people.

Now, I have a full time job, so how I am going to find the time to do all this?

Inspired by Randy's [blog post](https://blog.randy.gg/freeing-up-time), I've made a list of what I'm doing with the 168 hours we all have each week:  
- Sleeping (~49hours)
- Spending time with my family (~47h)
- Working (~40h)
- Playing video games (~14h)
- Gardening (~5h)
- Grooming (~3h)

Without even taking real life into account, I'm left with only *10 hours* to work on game dev.  

The first goal is to ship a game in 4 weeks on itch.io, stick around to follow my progress!

See you all next week!
