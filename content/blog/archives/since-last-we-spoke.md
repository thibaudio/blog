Hi there!  
I hope you had a great 2 weeks!

Last time we spoke, I was working on a 4 player pong (and I still am) but testing and debugging a steam multiplayer game [is a pain](slow-week)!  
To help, I wanted to decouple the multiplayer layer from the steam layer, so I could test locally my game without having 2 steam backend running.  

## Lobbies
I ended up creating a separate project that could be used as a starting point/example for a lobby based multiplayer game in godot.  
For now, there's only a Direct IP connection to localhost available, for rapid debugging, but I'll add the rest quickly.
You can check it out here: [Lobbies](https://gitlab.com/thibaudio/lobbies).  

No progress on the game other than that!  

## It takes some time
In this week's episode of [Coffee with Butterscotch](https://www.bscotch.net/podcast/388), Sam quoted:  
> If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.  

For me, it indeed takes time to condense a story, but not nearly as much as turning something into one.  
Anyway, that saying made me think a bit, so I had to look it up; coincidentally it's from [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal), a French mathematician and philosopher:

> Je n’ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n’ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte.  

## Stuff
Not so much to recommend this week, except for you to go watch [Autistic Video Games. We Need More Please.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopMHsHvghU) a great video essay by Gray Thorn!  

&nbsp;  

That's all for this week!  
Thank you all for reading, see you next week (or maybe the one after that)!
