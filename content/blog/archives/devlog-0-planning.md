I've worked with Unity while being employed in games and in other industries. On my own though, I only did game jams: **I'm a hobbyist solo developer**.  
Now I have just set a goal for myself: to **release a game next year**. It will be a roguelike, where you defend yourself against hordes of enemy spaceships by building turrets that attack on their own.  

## Old habits
In game jams, as soon as I have the slightest idea of what I want to do, I start developing it.  
As I already had a good understanding of the game I wanted to make, I started right away with a prototype. To test what? I didn't know.  
After losing two week trying different engines I finally came back to Unity. Not because it was better or anything, but simply because I was more proficient with it.  

## Emerging questions
When building a game jam game, some game design questions might emerge. I usually answer them without too much of a thought: it's a game jam game after all, we are here to try.  
While working on the prototype I found the same questions were much more difficult to answer: I was not ready to lock myself in a choice.  
While, in fact, making such decisions is what a prototype is for. After realising that, I write down all the possible choice, then try one. If it's not good I come back to the list and try another.

## Planning
One major downside of this method is: you don't know when to stop!  
[heartbeast](https://twitter.com/uheartbeast) wrote about this issue in [Production Point](https://heartgamedev.substack.com/p/production-point) and talked about it in a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsMHicoZTzQ).  One interesting point is that you don't want to plan during the prototyping phase because you'll likely make a inaccurate estimation of what needs to be done.  While this resonate a lot, I still need to deliver something next year, so I better not stay in this phase for too long. I ended up by adding only one item to the calendar: **leaving the prototyping phase in September**.   
  
Wish me luck!
