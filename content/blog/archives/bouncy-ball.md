Hi friends!  
I hope you all had a great week.

This week I've started to work on my next micro game: a 4 player, physics based, pong.  
Here is what the todo list looks like for now:  
- [X] Top down character controller
- [X] Dash
- [X] Bouncy ball in enclosed space
- [ ] Score goals
- [ ] Multiplayer
- [ ] Create / join lobby
- [ ] Movable walls
- [ ] Special abilities (Throw walls, dash, player quickly grows, ...)

It's still really early, but bouncing the ball is already fun!  
I don't think I'll be able to release this one in October though, the multiplayer part might take a bit!

## Godot starting template
Last week I worked on my starting template for godot, this week I found an already existing [really good godot starting template](https://github.com/Mad-Cookies-Studio/Godot-Project-Template?utm_source=pocket_mylist) by [Mad Cookies Studio](https://www.madcookies.games/).  
If you are looking for a starting point for your next Godot project, you should check it out!  
I still plan on continuing mine, because I like to keep a library of stuff that I already worked with.

Tiny one this week, not much happened; and I'm afraid next week will be even worse!
Still, thank you all for reading and see you next week!
