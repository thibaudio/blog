Ahoy mateys,  
It's been a minute!  

A lot of work recently, so I didn't had time to work on November's game.  
In december, I will also be participating in [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/), and you can check my progress on [github](https://github.com/thibaudio/aoc-2022).

I don't have much to write about this week, so I'm going to leave you with a quote of a great article I read today:  
> **Every tweet you read, every newspaper you glance at, every show you watch, every email you skim, it’s all feeding your subconscious things to process**. And whatever it’s fed, it will ferment into ideas and reactions. So if you want to come up with better ideas, you must get extremely strict about what you let in the door.  
[The Art of Fermenting Great Ideas](https://blog.nateliason.com/p/fermenting-great-ideas) by Bat Eliason  

By the way, I got this article via a newsletter you might want to check out: [The Sunday Filter](https://www.stephenwise.com/newsletter).

Have a great week everyone, and see you next time!
