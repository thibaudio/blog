## Commercial projects
### Spoon.AI
I worked on interactive robots at [Spoon.ai](https://spoon.ai/).  
The stack was a mix of C# in Unity for displaying the robot face on a screen, and simulating the physical world ; as well as C++ for the low level components like video and sound capture or streaming commands to the arm controller.  
During my time at Spoon, I also worked on a multiplayer VR simulation where multiple people can experience our different robots at the same time.
