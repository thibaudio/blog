You can find my game jams entry on [itch.io](https://thibaudio.itch.io/).  

## BloodLoop
I built the full multiplayer and live-service stack for [BloodLoop](https://www.bloodloop.com), a competitive hero shooter made in Unreal Engine 5, including the infrastructure, the backend services, the game client integrations, the tools and the build and deployment pipelines.

## Champions Tactics
As a Senior Online Programmer, I contributed to the multiplayer infrastructure and services for Ubisoft's Competitive Multiplayer Turn-Based RPG, [Champions Tactics Grimoria Chronicles](https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/).

## Spoon.AI
I worked on interactive robots at [Spoon.ai](https://spoon.ai/).  
The stack was a mix of C# in Unity for displaying the robot face on a screen, and simulating the physical world ; as well as C++ for the low level components like video and sound capture or streaming commands to the arm controller.  
During my time at Spoon, I also worked on a multiplayer VR simulation where multiple people can experience our different robots at the same time.

## Naturalium de Besançon
I co-developed 3 games for a museum in Besançon (France).
