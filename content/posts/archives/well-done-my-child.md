Hello friends!
I hope you all had a great week.

I've made some progress in the Little Red Riding Hood puzzle I am working on.  
First thing first: you can play the first 4 levels on [itch.io](https://thibaudio.itch.io/loupyestu?secret=zo7tZ4jsi02iBdMqAoixwQhBtA).
Comments are open, you are welcome to leave any feedback!

Here's what I still need to do:
- [X] Turn based actions
- [X] Wolf pathfinding
- [X] Loose condition
- [X] Obstacles
- [X] Door
- [X] Opening the door with Wolf -> Loose as well
- [X] Hunter kills wolf
- [X] Transitions
- [X] Gramgram can be eaten by the wolf, which gives us a little more time to escape
- [X] CI/CD
- [X] Better indication that we need to kill the wolf before escaping
- [X] Sound effect
- [X] Win screen
- [ ] Plate to open locked door
- [ ] Menu
- [ ] Options
- [ ] Save
- [ ] 6 levels
- [ ] In game menu
- [ ] Better death animation

## godot template
I also want to create and share a template for all my new godot game.  
I plan to have:  
- a main menu,
- an in game menu,
- an option menu with sound levels controls,
- a soundplayer singleton,
- a simple transition,
- a gitlab ci/cd pipeline

## next game
I'm on the finish line for this game, so I'm starting to think about the next one.  
Only thing I know, it's that I want to try to make an online multiplayer game.

## interesting stuff
- [Stop writing rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3xPIYHKSoI)
- [Self-hoster restream.io with nginx and a cheap VPS](https://bitkeks.eu/blog/2020/03/desktop-video-streaming-server-obs-studio-nginx-rtmp-hls-videojs.html)
- A quote from Special Bread I heard in this [Nice games club podcast episode](https://nicegames.club/episode/279)
> To me it's pretty important that people don't take me seriously because actually that just makes everything a lot more exciting and interesting

All right, this was a shorter one.  
Thanks for reading and see you next week!
