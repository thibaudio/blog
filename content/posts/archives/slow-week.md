Hello friends!  
Thanks for tuning in once again, I hope you all had a great week!  

As anticipated in my last post, this week was really slow for me - so this post will be extremely short!  

## Multiplayer with Steam
I started working on the multiplayer aspect of my October's game (which will release in November).  
It is really easy to get up and running with [GodotSteam](https://gramps.github.io/GodotSteam).  
For now, it's just a bit painful to test, because when using SteamWorks as a lobby / p2p networking solution, you need to have 2 different steam accounts connected. I didn't find a better solution than to start the game on 2 different VMs.  
I'm thinking about implementing a simpler transport layer, just for testing purposes. There's already a [How to remove steam](https://gramps.github.io/GodotSteam/tutorials-remove-steam.html) guide in the GodotSteam docs.

The new todo list for the project:
- [X] Top down character controller
- [X] Dash
- [X] Bouncy ball in enclosed space
- [ ] Create / join lobby (mostly done)
- [ ] Multiplayer gameplay
- [ ] Score goals
- [ ] Movable walls
- [ ] Special abilities (Throw walls, dash, player quickly grows, ...)
- [ ] Matchmaking?

Is that really all?  
Yes :)  
See you next week!
