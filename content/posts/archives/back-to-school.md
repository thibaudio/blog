I was writing [last week](/posts/scoping-with-time) about wanting to create more games, and I estimated that I could dedicate 10 hours per week to game dev. With that, I set out to make a game and releasing it by the end of the month.  

## Back to school everyone!
Summer vacation ended for the all family this week, so I wasn't sure I would have time to even start working on anything. Fortunately, I was wrong!  

I followed this [great platformer tutorial by HeartBeast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3WGFwCduY0&list=PL9FzW-m48fn16W1Sz5bhTd1ArQQv4f-Cm), with the intent of turning it into a small releasable game.
I had time to finish the tutorial, and also worked on some of the tasks I wanted to do before release:  
- [X] Options menu
- [X] Save/Load System
- [X] Option to select the character skin
- [X] Main Menu
- [ ] Option to adjust the sound level
- [ ] Add music
- [ ] Add a shooting enemy
- [ ] 10 Levels
- [ ] Win condition
- [ ] Controller support
- [ ] itch.io page
- [ ] Option to rebind controls?
- [ ] Level selection screen?
- [ ] Collectible Ã  la Celeste?

This list will surely evolve and grow, I only need to keep in mind that I only have 30 hours left!

## Kids are the best game designers
I was playing with my daughters the other day, I they were inventing a game were they need to run away from the wolf, and try to lure him in front of the hunter to win.  
What a great idea for a puzzle game!
On a grid were everyone move 1 cell at a time, your character, followed closely by a wolf, must go to a hunter without him being seen by the wolf.  
Looks like I already have my game for next month!

Alright, that's all!  
Thanks a lot for reading and I'll see you next week!
