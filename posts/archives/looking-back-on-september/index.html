<meta name=title content="Looking Back on September"><meta name=description content="Hi friends,
I hope you had a great week!
To start off, I wanted to reflect back on September a bit.
At the start of the month, I challenged myself: I&rsquo;d be gamedev&rsquo;in 10 hours a week and releasing a micro game every month.
Well, so far so good! In September I released a micro platformer, and I even released a new game this week!
To be fair, the scope of both these games is incredibly small, but they got me started. With 3 weeks to go in October, I&rsquo;ll aim for a little bit bigger scope - in the form of a multiplayer game."><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.thibaud.io/posts/archives/looking-back-on-september/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="rheneross"><meta property="og:title" content="Looking Back on September"><meta property="og:description" content="Hi friends, I hope you had a great week!

Well, so far so good! In September I released a <a href=https://thibaudio.itch.io/pixel-platformer>micro platformer</a>, and I even released a new game this week!<br>To be fair, the scope of both these games is incredibly small, but they got me started. With 3 weeks to go in October, I&rsquo;ll aim for a little bit bigger scope - in the form of a multiplayer game.</p><p>This week though, I didn&rsquo;t do much game development. It was still a pretty productive week. Let&rsquo;s dive in!</p><h2 id=loupyestu>loupyestu</h2><p>I released loupyestu, the puzzle game I was working on, on itch.io. Here is the page if you want to try it:</p><p>The first 3 levels are tutorials, while the last 2 are a bit more puzzly. Nothing crazy though, I found very difficult to come out with good puzzles. First I&rsquo;m not a big puzzle player, and the set of mechanism I added is a bit simplistic.</p><p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s what the todo list looked like at the end:</p><ul><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Turn based actions</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Wolf pathfinding</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Loose condition</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Obstacles</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Door</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Opening the door with Wolf -> Loose as well</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Hunter kills wolf</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Transitions</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Gramgram can be eaten by the wolf, which gives us a little more time to escape</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> CI/CD</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Better indication that we need to kill the wolf before escaping</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Sound effect</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Win screen</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Plate to open locked door</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> 5 levels</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Menu</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Options</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Save</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> In game menu</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Better death animation</li></ul><p>As you can see, I didn&rsquo;t add menus and saves. That&rsquo;s because I already added them to my other project of this week:</p><h2 id=godot-starting-template>godot starting template</h2><p>I started working on a template for all my games. It&rsquo;s open source, and you can find it here: <a href=https://gitlab.com/thibaudio/godot_game_template>https://gitlab.com/thibaudio/godot_game_template</a>.
There&rsquo;s still a lot missing, but I&rsquo;m planning to add more features while I&rsquo;m building new games.</p><h2 id=rust-nested-windows-manager>rust-nested-windows-manager</h2><p>Another project I started this week was a custom window manager, inspired by the one <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/kebabskal>Kebabskal</a> built.<br>The goal is to be able to tag a window, for example godot, and have it handle by the window manager. Then it will just stacked all the tagged window in a dedicated portion of my screen.
It&rsquo;s in rust and not finished at all, but you can still check it out here: <a href=https://github.com/thibaudio/rust-nested-window-manager>https://github.com/thibaudio/rust-nested-window-manager</a>.</p><h2 id=cherry-on-top>cherry on top</h2><p>This week I even spent some time revamping my <a href=https://blog.thibaud.io>site</a>: I updated the front page a bit, and also added a space to showcase my <a href=https://blog.thibaud.io/games/>projects</a>.</p><h2 id=next-game-project>Next game project</h2><p>With that said, it&rsquo;s time to get back in the gamez! This week I&rsquo;ll start working on my new project. For now, all I know is that it will be a 2vs2 multiplayer game with 10-15min session time.<br>More on that next week!</p><p> </p><p>All right, thanks for reading!<br>See you all next time.</p><p>P.S. <a href="https://twitter.com/_IAmSaKo_/status/1578934019353214976?s=20&amp;t=B9OYOoF9RLSBhLCwxxruLg">This awesome tweet</a></p></content><p></p></main><footer><small><a href=https://blog.thibaud.io/index.xml>RSS</a> | <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/rheneross.com>bluesky</a> | Made with <a href=https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub>Bear Cub</a></small></footer></body></html>
