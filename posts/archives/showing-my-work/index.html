<meta name=title content="Showing My Work"><meta name=description content="I&rsquo;ve just finish reading the book Show your work! by Austin Kleon, and it gave me the push I needed to start my little place online.
I&rsquo;m planning to share here some of my work around site reliability engineering and game development. Wish me luck!
But first, let&rsquo;s talk about the stack of this very site.



I wanted something static: it&rsquo;s easy to maintain and there&rsquo;s basically no operations needed. I had a look at what was available and choosed Hugo. 
I&rsquo;ve picked a theme, hello-friend-ng, from https://themes.gohugo.io/ and rolled with it.
For hosting, I followed the official hugo guide to host on github pages."><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.thibaud.io/posts/archives/showing-my-work/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="rheneross"><meta property="og:title" content="Showing My Work"><meta property="og:description" content="I’ve just finish reading the book Show your work! by Austin Kleon, and it gave me the push I needed to start my little place online.
