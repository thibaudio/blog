Old habits
In game jams, as soon as I have the slightest idea of what I want to do, I start developing it.
As I already had a good understanding of the game I wanted to make, I started right away with a prototype. To test what? I didn&rsquo;t know.
After losing two week trying different engines I finally came back to Unity. Not because it was better or anything, but simply because I was more proficient with it."><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.thibaud.io/posts/archives/devlog-0-planning/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="rheneross"><meta property="og:title" content="Devlog 0  - Planning?!"><meta property="og:description" content="I’ve worked with Unity while being employed in games and in other industries.

I usually answer them without too much of a thought: it&rsquo;s a game jam game after all, we are here to try.<br>While working on the prototype I found the same questions were much more difficult to answer: I was not ready to lock myself in a choice.<br>While, in fact, making such decisions is what a prototype is for. After realising that, I write down all the possible choice, then try one. If it&rsquo;s not good I come back to the list and try another.</p><figure><img src=/svgs/prototype-flow.svg alt="My prototype flow"></figure><h2 id=planning>Planning</h2><p>One major downside of this method is: you don&rsquo;t know when to stop!<br><a href=https://twitter.com/uheartbeast>heartbeast</a> wrote about this issue in <a href=https://heartgamedev.substack.com/p/production-point>Production Point</a> and talked about it in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsMHicoZTzQ">short video</a>. One interesting point is that you don&rsquo;t want to plan during the prototyping phase because you&rsquo;ll likely make a inaccurate estimation of what needs to be done. While this resonate a lot, I still need to deliver something next year, so I better not stay in this phase for too long. I ended up by adding only one item to the calendar: <strong>leaving the prototyping phase in September</strong>.</p><p>Wish me luck!</p></content><p></p></main><footer><small><a href=https://blog.thibaud.io/index.xml>RSS</a> | <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/rheneross.com>bluesky</a> | Made with <a href=https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub>Bear Cub</a></small></footer></body></html>
