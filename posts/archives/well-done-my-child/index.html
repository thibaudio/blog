<meta name=title content="Well Done My Child"><meta name=description content="Hello friends!
I hope you all had a great week.
I&rsquo;ve made some progress in the Little Red Riding Hood puzzle I am working on.
First thing first: you can play the first 4 levels on itch.io.
Comments are open, you are welcome to leave any feedback!
Here&rsquo;s what I still need to do:

 Turn based actions
 Wolf pathfinding
 Loose condition
 Obstacles
 Door
 Opening the door with Wolf -> Loose as well
 Hunter kills wolf
 Transitions
 Gramgram can be eaten by the wolf, which gives us a little more time to escape
 CI/CD
 Better indication that we need to kill the wolf before escaping
 Sound effect
 Win screen
 Plate to open locked door
 Menu
 Options
 Save
 6 levels
 In game menu
 Better death animation

godot template
I also want to create and share a template for all my new godot game.
