<meta name=title content="Bouncy ball"><meta name=description content="Hi friends!
I hope you all had a great week.
This week I&rsquo;ve started to work on my next micro game: a 4 player, physics based, pong.
Here is what the todo list looks like for now:

 Top down character controller
 Dash
 Bouncy ball in enclosed space
 Score goals
 Multiplayer
 Create / join lobby
 Movable walls
 Special abilities (Throw walls, dash, player quickly grows, &mldr;)

It&rsquo;s still really early, but bouncing the ball is already fun!
I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to release this one in October though, the multiplayer part might take a bit!"><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.thibaud.io/posts/archives/bouncy-ball/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="rheneross"><meta property="og:title" content="Bouncy ball"><meta property="og:description" content="Hi friends!
