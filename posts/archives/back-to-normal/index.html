<meta name=title content="Back to Normal"><meta name=description content="Hi friends!
I hope you all had a great week.
Last week I talked about how I had more time than I anticipated to be gamedev&rsquo;in, well turns out that this week was the opposite.
I thought I would have 10 hours, but I only had 4: sometimes I&rsquo;m too burned-out by my day job to open an editor in the evening.
Anyway, I still made a bit of progress, here&rsquo;s what the todo-list looks like now:"><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.thibaud.io/posts/archives/back-to-normal/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="rheneross"><meta property="og:title" content="Back to Normal"><meta property="og:description" content="Hi friends!

You can get inspired by it, and it will be taken into account by the voters, but it&rsquo;s not required in your submission. There is another constraint though: a Focus, that you need to implement in your game.
This year it was <code>Multi-Use</code>, and even though I was not planning on participating, it did spawn an idea in my head: a shield that can be use to block, charge (dash), or to be thrown at enemies. A really unique idea, no one ever thought of; not even Blizzard or Marvel.<br><figure><img src=/images/d3-paladin.jpg alt="Diablo3 Paladin"></figure><br>I added it to the todo-list, but I don&rsquo;t think I will have time to get to that point: I only have 20hours remaining.</p><h2 id=gitlab-cicd>Gitlab CI/CD</h2><p>Implementing a automatic build and deployment system was fairly easy!
