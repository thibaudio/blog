<meta name=title content="Let There Be Red"><meta name=description content="Hi everyone, I hope you all had a great weekend!
Today I&rsquo;m releasing my micro game, and you can all play it and give me some feedback on the itch.io page
It all started 3 weeks ago, when I settled on releasing on game each month.
This month, I started following HeartBeast great godot tutorial, that I wanted to turn into a small but finished game.
Here&rsquo;s the final todo-list:

 Complete the tutorial
 Options menu
 Save/Load System
 Option to select the character skin
 Main Menu
 Option to adjust the sound level
 Collectibles
 itch.io page
 gitlab CI/CD to automatically build and push to itch.io
 Tweak the character controller
 Add a shooting enemy
 Win screen
 In game menu
 Credits
 Add music
 3 levels
 Fix starting music
 Controller support
 Fix HTML export?
 Find better fonts
 Shield? (to block and throw at enemies) - removed
 Unlockable abilities (double jump, dash, &mldr;)
 Option to rebind controls?
 Level selection screen?

At the end, I decided to remove the shield ability, as it was not fitting at all with the rest of the game."><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.thibaud.io/posts/archives/let-there-be-red/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="rheneross"><meta property="og:title" content="Let There Be Red"><meta property="og:description" content="Hi everyone, I hope you all had a great weekend!
