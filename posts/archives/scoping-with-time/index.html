<meta name=title content="(S)coping with time"><meta name=description content="Hi there!
I hope you are all doing great.
I&rsquo;m back from some well deserved vacations, where I had time to do some thinking:
My life goal is be able to sustain my family with money from making games and vegetables from our garden, so I better start working toward this.
The first milestone is to get good at making games.
I don&rsquo;t want to make the perfect game, I don&rsquo;t expect to make money, I only want to become good at shipping games - so I need to ship a lot of games.
While I&rsquo;m at it, I&rsquo;ll also work on my visibility, and try to have my games played by more and more people."><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.thibaud.io/posts/archives/scoping-with-time/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="rheneross"><meta property="og:title" content="(S)coping with time"><meta property="og:description" content="Hi there!
