Thanks for tuning in once again, I hope you all had a great week!
As anticipated in my last post, this week was really slow for me - so this post will be extremely short!
Multiplayer with Steam
I started working on the multiplayer aspect of my October&rsquo;s game (which will release in November).
It is really easy to get up and running with GodotSteam.
For now, it&rsquo;s just a bit painful to test, because when using SteamWorks as a lobby / p2p networking solution, you need to have 2 different steam accounts connected. I didn&rsquo;t find a better solution than to start the game on 2 different VMs.
I&rsquo;m thinking about implementing a simpler transport layer, just for testing purposes. There&rsquo;s already a How to remove steam guide in the GodotSteam docs."><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.thibaud.io/posts/archives/slow-week/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="rheneross"><meta property="og:title" content="Slow Week"><meta property="og:description" content="Hello friends!
