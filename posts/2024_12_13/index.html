I have enough savings to cover about 10 months of expenses, which might sound like a lot to some.
But this looming uncertainty â€” distant as it may be â€” keeps me up at night. I am deeply worried about not being able to provide for my family, so I&rsquo;ve sent out resume everywhere&mldr; and I got a job offer.<br>After hundreds of applications, tens of interviews, I got a job offer.</p><p>It&rsquo;s an interesting technical subject, even if it&rsquo;s not in the game industry. It&rsquo;s a 15 minute ride from where I live, the culture seems really chill&mldr; but there&rsquo;s a catch:</p><p><strong>no remote work</strong>.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been fully remote since 2018, and it allowed me to spend more time with my daughters, work on side projects, and even have the space to feel not-so-great from time to time.
I&rsquo;m not sure if I can handle a fully in-office job anymore.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s do a pros/cons list!</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>A stable job - Less money anxiety for me and my family</li><li>Working in one of the most advanced field in computer science</li><li>Literally 15 minutes away from my home</li><li>Flexible working hours</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>A stable job - I really like the <em>free</em> part of freelancer</li><li>Not in the game industry</li><li>No remote work</li><li>No remote work â€” not even a little</li><li>No remote work â€” not at all</li><li>No remote work â€” <strong>NONE</strong></li></ul><p>WELL, looks like there&rsquo;s more cons ðŸ™‚</p><p>The thing is, I would love to have a bit of a break, to get time to work on my game engine and release some games made with it, maybe stream the process a bit?
I&rsquo;ll need to summon the courage to stay unemployed though.</p><p>That&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m not caving, I&rsquo;m not taking the job.</p><p>I am not scared anymore.<br>I will stay free, for now.</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/life/>#life</a>
