My previous attempt at a blog was retired at the time, so I went for the fastest way to publish anything: a newsletter platform.

The void is my audience, and it shall not grow!</p><p>So, I dug back out my old blog, dusted it off, and published it again. I migrated the two articles and reclaimed my digital ownership! I even kept my old posts from 2022 — though I wouldn’t recommend diving too deep into them.</p><blockquote><p>I was lucky to have my roots in websites because I always understood the value of building my own online spaces, and hosting everything that mattered to me on my own sites.<br>— <a href=https://www.nathalielawhead.com/candybox/positive-feedback-loops-the-power-of-choice-digital-independence-and-building-something-better-for-everyone>Nathalie Lawhead</a></p></blockquote><p>I have always value my digital independence, and I self-host a lot of services. I also believe that, as long as you control the source material, not everything needs to be <em>strictly</em> self-hosted. For example, this blog is a static site hosted on github pages and, even if github stop offering the service, I can move it somewhere else without loosing anything.</p><p>Aside from that, I&rsquo;ve been playing through my backlog a lot lately:</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;ve finished Portal Stories: Mel, a nice story for people wanting more Portal.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve played a couple of chapters of Black Mesa, astonishing work!</li><li>I enjoyed Tinyfolks a lot. It&rsquo;s a tiny, more forgiving, Darkest Dungeon.</li><li>Clickholding: this one I can&rsquo;t say anything about, you&rsquo;d have to see it for yourself.</li><li>And lastly, I&rsquo;ve just started DREDGE, but I love it already :)</li></ul><p>Tinyfolks especially motivated me to start working on a tiny game - we&rsquo;ll see were it leads!</p><p>Until then, have a nice week and see you next time!</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/games/>#games</a>
