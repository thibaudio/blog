Sometimes, though, I feel the urge to write something public and share it with the void.</p>
<p>Recently, the urge returned: I&rsquo;ve been fixating on ways to cooperate differently, especially in the game industry, and I had to get it out of my system. My previous attempt at a blog was retired at the time, so I went for the fastest way to publish anything: a newsletter platform. I wrote two articles, and then the emails flooded in. <em>&ldquo;Grow your audience fast with fastaudiencegrowth&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Subscribe to our premium platform and win your subscribers&rsquo; weight in gold.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Begone, devil! The void is my audience, and it shall not grow!</p>
<p>So, I dug back out my old blog, dusted it off, and published it again. I migrated the two articles and reclaimed my digital ownership! I even kept my old posts from 2022 — though I wouldn’t recommend diving too deep into them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was lucky to have my roots in websites because I always understood the value of building my own online spaces, and hosting everything that mattered to me on my own sites.<br>

<p>I have always value my digital independence, and I self-host a lot of services. I also believe that, as long as you control the source material, not everything needs to be <em>strictly</em> self-hosted. For example, this blog is a static site hosted on github pages and, even if github stop offering the service, I can move it somewhere else without loosing anything.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I&rsquo;ve been playing through my backlog a lot lately:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve finished Portal Stories: Mel, a nice story for people wanting more Portal.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve played a couple of chapters of Black Mesa, astonishing work!</li>
<li>I enjoyed Tinyfolks a lot. It&rsquo;s a tiny, more forgiving, Darkest Dungeon.</li>
<li>Clickholding: this one I can&rsquo;t say anything about, you&rsquo;d have to see it for yourself.</li>
<li>And lastly, I&rsquo;ve just started DREDGE, but I love it already :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tinyfolks especially motivated me to start working on a tiny game - we&rsquo;ll see were it leads!</p>
<p>Until then, have a nice week and see you next time!</p>
