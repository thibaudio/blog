&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m an independent developer in the video game industry, and my current project is slowly wrapping up. I have enough savings to cover about 10 months of expenses, which might sound like a lot to some.

<p>I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an independent developer in the video game industry, and my current project is slowly wrapping up. I have enough savings to cover about 10 months of expenses, which might sound like a lot to some.
But this looming uncertainty â€” distant as it may be â€” keeps me up at night. I am deeply worried about not being able to provide for my family, so I&rsquo;ve sent out resume everywhere&hellip; and I got a job offer.<br>
After hundreds of applications, tens of interviews, I got a job offer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting technical subject, even if it&rsquo;s not in the game industry. It&rsquo;s a 15 minute ride from where I live, the culture seems really chill&hellip; but there&rsquo;s a catch:</p>
<p><strong>no remote work</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fully remote since 2018, and it allowed me to spend more time with my daughters, work on side projects, and even have the space to feel not-so-great from time to time.
I&rsquo;m not sure if I can handle a fully in-office job anymore.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a pros/cons list!</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stable job - Less money anxiety for me and my family</li>
<li>Working in one of the most advanced field in computer science</li>
<li>Literally 15 minutes away from my home</li>
<li>Flexible working hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stable job - I really like the <em>free</em> part of freelancer</li>
<li>Not in the game industry</li>
<li>No remote work</li>
<li>No remote work â€” not even a little</li>
<li>No remote work â€” not at all</li>
<li>No remote work â€” <strong>NONE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>WELL, looks like there&rsquo;s more cons ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>The thing is, I would love to have a bit of a break, to get time to work on my game engine and release some games made with it, maybe stream the process a bit?
I&rsquo;ll need to summon the courage to stay unemployed though.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m not caving, I&rsquo;m not taking the job.</p>
<p>I am not scared anymore.<br>
I will stay free, for now.</p>
