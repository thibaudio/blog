BloodLoop
I built the full multiplayer and live-service stack for BloodLoop, a competitive hero shooter made in Unreal Engine 5, including the infrastructure, the backend services, the game client integrations, the tools and the build and deployment pipelines.
Champions Tactics
As a Senior Online Programmer, I contributed to the multiplayer infrastructure and services for Ubisoft&rsquo;s Competitive Multiplayer Turn-Based RPG, Champions Tactics Grimoria Chronicles.
Spoon.AI
I worked on interactive robots at Spoon.ai.
The stack was a mix of C# in Unity for displaying the robot face on a screen, and simulating the physical world ; as well as C++ for the low level components like video and sound capture or streaming commands to the arm controller.
During my time at Spoon, I also worked on a multiplayer VR simulation where multiple people can experience our different robots at the same time.
